## Lambda Component

Lambda component is a [Serverless Devs](https://docs.serverless-devs.com/en) for Lambda. It helps you more easily manage all the resources of lambda and quickly start a serverless application based on lambda.
> The [Wiki](https://github.com/liufangchen/lambda/wiki) is the documentation source

## Features

- **Full lifecycle management**: manages a project during its lifecycle, including creation, development, debugging, deployment, and O&M.
- **Security release**: automatically detects the changes in functions.
- **Quick integration**: integrates with common CI/CD tools. For more information, see [CI/CD tools](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/blob/master/docs/en/cicd.md).
- **Observability**: allows you to query metrics and logs on your client. For more information, see [Query metrics](en/command/metrics.md) and [Query logs](en/command/logs.md).
- **Multi-mode debugging**: supports multi-mode debugging to meet different debugging requirements in the development state and O&M state. The modes include [local call](en/command/local.md), [remote debugging](en/command/invoke.md), and [cloud-terminal joint debugging](en/command/proxied.md).

## Quickstart
- Prerequisites
    - [Serverless Devs](https://docs.serverless-devs.com/serverless-devs/install)
    - [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)
    - [AWS Credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
- Execute the `s` command:
    ```shell script
    $ s
    ? Serverless Devs project is not detected. Do you want to create a new project? (Y/n) 
    ```  
- Fill in `y` and press Enter to enter the creation guide section:
    ```shell script
    üöÄ Serverless Awesome: https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/package-awesome
    
    ? Hello Serverless for Cloud Vendors (Use arrow keys or type to search)
    ‚ùØ Alibaba Cloud Serverless 
      AWS Cloud Serverless 
      Baidu Cloud Serverless 
      Huawei Cloud Serverless 
      Tencent Cloud Serverless 
      Dev Template for Serverless Devs 
    ```

- At the same time, you only need to select the corresponding option and follow the instructions. For example, if you select `Aws Cloud Serverless`, you can see the classification of application templates under AWS Serverless products:

    ```shell script
    ? Please select an Serverless-Devs Application (Use arrow keys or type to search)
    ‚ùØ TODO
    ```

- At this time, you can continue to select specific applications under a certain category for initialization. For example, after selecting `lambda-runtime-starter`, you can see the specific template applications under that category:

    ```shell script
    ? Please select an templete (Use arrow keys or type to search)
    ‚ùØ TODO
    ```

- Select `lambda-http-nodejs` to complete the creation. During the boot process, the process of filling in the project name and selecting the key may appear:
    - The project name can be: `start-lambda-http-nodejs12`
    - The key can be the one we created above: `aws-access`

- Deploy Function to Lambda
    ```shell script
    $ s deploy
    TODO
    ```
